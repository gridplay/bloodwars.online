 Server in java for the Bloodwars Online MMO

 Still setting up the code work with Unity. So far can receive json but Unity isnt receiving anything
 
 All help is welcomed.
 
 I put the source code for this server's MMO open because i believe that all online games should have its server source open so others can run their own server.
 
 Tell their story of the game using assets or just have fun

# BWS
Server in java for the Bloodwars Online MMO

BWS stands for BloodWars Server

Still setting up the code work with Unity.

All help is welcomed.

I put the source code for this server's MMO open because i believe that all online games should have its server source open so others can run their own server.

Tell their story of the game using assets or just have fun

May 18 2024 - Got it working with Unity 6. Had to write my own TCP in unity to get it to work. For now we roll with sending JSON messages.

If anyone like to help with a better way of sending and receiving messages between this and Unity 6 please hit me up on discord as venx84

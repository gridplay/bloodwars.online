# BWS
 Server in java for the Bloodwars Online MMO
 
 BWS stands for BloodWars Server

 Still setting up the code work with Unity. So far can receive json but Unity isnt receiving anything
 
 All help is welcomed.
 
 I put the source code for this server's MMO open because i believe that all online games should have its server source open so others can run their own server.
 
 Tell their story of the game using assets or just have fun

 As of May 16 2024 decided to try Riptide in Unity as a server. Will leave this repo up incase i ever come back to this idea or for anyone who looking to get started with their own java based server

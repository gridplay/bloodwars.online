# EoEs
Server in java for the Eclipse of Eternity

EoEs stands for Eclipse of Eternity Server

Still setting up the code work with Unity.

All help is welcomed.

I put the source code for this server's MMO open because i believe that all online games should have its server source open so others can run their own server.

Tell their story of the game using assets or just have fun

May 18 2024 - Got it working with Unity 6. Had to write my own TCP in unity to get it to work. For now we roll with sending JSON messages.

If anyone like to help with a better way of sending and receiving messages between this and Unity 6 please hit me up on discord as venx84

As of May 22 2024 thanks to ChatGPT found out that BloodWars is already a MMO so with its help on a new name went with Eclipse of Eternity.

June 4 2024 - This could be the last upload of this server as im tired of stupid errors in Eclipse and how clumbsy java feels.
Looking into other network solutions for EoE.
